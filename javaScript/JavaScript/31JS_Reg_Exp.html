<!--
Regular Expressions:
==> A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
==> The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.

Syntax:
/pattern/modifiers;

Example:
var patt = /neosphere/i;
==> neosphere  is a pattern (to be used in a search).
==> i  is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).


==> regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: 
search() and replace().
==> The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.
==> The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

Regular Expression Modifiers:
==> Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive more global searches:
Modifier	Description	
i			Perform case-insensitive matching	
g			Perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match)	
m			Perform multiline matching

<p>Click the button to do a global search for "is" in a string.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  var str = "Is this all there is?";
  var patt1 = /is/g;
  var result = str.match(patt1);
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = result;
}
</script>

<!--
Regular Expression Patterns:
==> Brackets are used to find a range of characters:

Expression	Description	
[abc]		Find any of the characters between the brackets	
[^abc]		Find any character NOT between the brackets
[0-9]		Find any of the digits between the brackets
[^0-9]		Find any character NOT between the brackets (any non-digit)	
(x|y)		Find any of the alternatives separated with |

==> Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:
Metacharacter	Description	
\d				Find a digit	
\s				Find a whitespace character	
\b				Find a match at the beginning or at the end of a word	
\uxxxx			Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx

Quantifiers define quantities:
Quantifier	Description	Try it
n+			Matches any string that contains at least one n
n*			Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?			Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

RegExp Object:
test():
==> It searches a string for a pattern, and returns true or false, depending on the result.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>JavaScript Regular Expressions</h2>
<p>Search for an "e" in the next paragraph:</p>
<p id="p01">The best things in life are free!</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
text = document.getElementById("p01").innerHTML; 
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = /e/.test(text);
</script>
</body>
</html>

exec():
==> The exec() method is a RegExp expression method.
==> It searches a string for a specified pattern, and returns the found text as an object.
==> If no match is found, it returns an empty (null) object.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
var obj = /e/.exec("The best things in life are free!");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Found " + obj[0] + " in position " + obj.index + " in the text: " + obj.input;
