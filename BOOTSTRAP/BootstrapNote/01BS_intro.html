Bootstrap:
==> Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework 
for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.

Advantages of Bootstrap:
==> Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can 
start using Bootstrap
==> Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, 
tablets, and desktops
==> Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap 3, mobile-first styles are part 
of the core framework
==> Browser compatibility: Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers 
(Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, and Opera)


There are two ways to start using Bootstrap on your own web site:
==> Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com
==> Include Bootstrap from a CDN

Downloading Bootstrap:
If you want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, go to getbootstrap.com, 
and follow the instructions there.

Bootstrap CDN:
If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, you can include it 
from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript:

Latest compiled and minified CSS 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">

Latest compiled JavaScript
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

You must also include jQuery:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

jQuery:
Bootstrap uses jQuery for JavaScript plugins (like modals, tooltips, etc). However, if you just use the 
CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need jQuery.


Create First Web Page With Bootstrap:
1. Add the HTML5 doctype

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"> 
  </head>
</html>

2. Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first
==> Bootstrap 3 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. 
Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

==> width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width 
of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

==> initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first 
loaded by the browser.


3. Containers:
==> Bootstrap also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.
==> There are two container classes to choose from:
	==> The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
	==> The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning
	the entire width of the viewport
