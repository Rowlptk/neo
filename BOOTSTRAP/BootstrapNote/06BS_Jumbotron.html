<!--
Jumbotron and Page Header:
==> A jumbotron indicates a big box for calling extra attention 
to some special content or information.
==> Use a <div> element with class .jumbotron to create a jumbotron:

<div class="container">
  <div class="jumbotron">
    <h1>Bootstrap Tutorial</h1> 
    <p>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing
    responsive, mobile-first projects on the web.</p> 
  </div>
  <p>This is some text.</p> 
  <p>This is another text.</p> 
</div


Page Header:
==> A page header is like a section divider.
==> Use a <div> element with class .page-header to create a page header:
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Example Page Header</h1>
</div>

Wells:
==> The .well class adds a rounded border around an element with a gray background 
color and some padding:
<div class="well">Basic Well</div>

Well Size:
==> Change the size of the well by adding the .well-sm class for small wells or  
.well-lg class for large wells:
<div class="well well-sm">Small Well</div>
<div class="well well-lg">Large Well</div>

==> By default, wells are medium in size.

Alerts:
==> Alerts are created with the .alert class, followed by one of the four contextual 
classes .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning or .alert-danger:

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <strong>Success!</strong> Indicates a successful or positive action.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Info!</strong> Indicates a neutral informative change or action.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Warning!</strong> Indicates a warning that might need attention.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-danger">
  <strong>Danger!</strong> Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action.
</div>

Alert Links:
==> Add the alert-link class to any links inside the alert box to create
"matching colored links":
<div class="alert alert-success">
  <strong>Success!</strong> You should <a href="#" class="alert-link">read this message</a>.
</div>

Closing Alerts:
==> To close the alert message, add a .alert-dismissible class to the alert container. 
Then add class="close" and data-dismiss="alert" to a link or a button element 
(when you click on this the alert box will disappear).

<div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible">
  <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
  <strong>Success!</strong> Indicates a successful or positive action.
</div>

Animated Alerts:
==> The .fade and .in classes adds a fading effect when closing the alert message:
<div class="alert alert-danger fade in">
