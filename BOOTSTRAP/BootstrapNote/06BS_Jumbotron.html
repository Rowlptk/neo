.well-lg class for large wells:
<div class="well well-sm">Small Well</div>
<div class="well well-lg">Large Well</div>

classes .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning or .alert-danger:

</div>

Closing Alerts:

Then add class="close" and data-dismiss="alert" to a link or a button element 
(when you click on this the alert box will disappear).

<div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible">
  <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
  <strong>Success!</strong> Indicates a successful or positive action.
</div>
