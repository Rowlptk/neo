<!--
The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).

$scope:
When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) 
gets access to these properties.
In the view, you do not use the prefix $scope, you just refer to a propertyname, like {{carname}}.

Root Scope:
All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element 
that contains the ng-app directive.
The rootScope is available in the entire application.
