<!--
font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. 
If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on.

Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick 
a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, 
like: "Times New Roman".
