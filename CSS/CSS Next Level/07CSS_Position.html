<!--
position Property
==> position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element 
(static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).

There are five different position values:

==> static
- default.
- not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
- is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page

 
==> relative
- is positioned relative to its normal position.
- Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element 
will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. 

- Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

==> fixed
- is positioned relative to the viewport, 
which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
- The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
- does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

==> absolute
- is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
(instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
- if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

==> sticky
- is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
- toggles between relative and fixed, 
depending on the scroll position. 

- It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport 
- then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).


==> z-index
- When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.
- The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element 
(which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
- An element can have a positive or negative stack order:

<h2>position: absolute;</h2>

<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

<div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
  <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
</div>
