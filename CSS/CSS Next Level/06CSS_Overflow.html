Overflow:
==> overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.

The overflow property has the following values:

==>visible 
- Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box

==>hidden 
- The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible

==>scroll 
- The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content

==>auto 
- Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

==> Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.

==> The overflow-x and overflow-y properties specifies whether to change the overflow 
of content just horizontally or vertically (or both):
