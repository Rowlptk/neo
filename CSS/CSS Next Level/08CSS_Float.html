<!--
float and clear:
==> float property specifies how an element should float.
==> clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.

float property can have one of the following values:

==> left 
- The element floats to the left of its container

==> right
- The element floats to the right of its container

==> none 
- The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default

==> inherit 
- The element inherits the float value of its parent

==> In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.


The clear property can have one of the following values:

==> none 
- Allows floating elements on both sides. This is default
==> left 
- No floating elements allowed on the left side
==> right
- No floating elements allowed on the right side
==> both 
- No floating elements allowed on either the left or the right side
==> inherit 
- The element inherits the clear value of its parent


==> The most common way to use the clear property is after you have used a float property on an element.

<h2>Without clear</h2>
<div class="div1">div1</div>
<div class="div2">div2 - Notice that div2 is after div1 in the HTML code. 
However, since div1 floats to the left, the text in div2 flows around div1.</div>
<br><br>

<h2>With clear</h2>
<div class="div3">div3</div>
<div class="div4">div4 - Here, clear: left; moves div4 down below the floating div3. 
The value "left" clears elements floated to the left. You can also clear "right" and "both".</div>
