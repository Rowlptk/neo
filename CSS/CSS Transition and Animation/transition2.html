Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition

The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
==>	ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
	linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
	ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
	ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
	ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
	cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.7, 1.0, 0.5);

A Cubic Bezier curve is defined by four points P0, P1, P2, and P3. 
P0 and P3 are the start and the end of the curve and, 
in CSS these points are fixed as the coordinates are ratios. 
P0 is (0, 0) and represents the initial time and the initial state, 
P3 is (1, 1) and represents the final time and the final state.
