1. What is jQuery?
==>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
==>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

2. Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
==>There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:
	a. Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
	b. Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google

3. Downloading jQuery
==> There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

	a. Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed
	b. Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)
		Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with 
the HTML <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):

	<head>
	<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
	</head>

4. jQuery CDN
==>If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
	Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery.

	To use jQuery from Google or Microsoft, use one of the following:
	Google CDN:
	
	<head>
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	</head>
	
	Microsoft CDN:
	<head>
	<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
	</head>
