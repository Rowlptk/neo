<!--
Videos in HTML:
==> Before HTML5, a video could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).
==> The HTML5 <video> element specifies a standard way to embed a video in a web page.
-->

<!-- To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

</body>
</html>

<!--
==> The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
==> It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. 
If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
-->

<!-- To start a video automatically use the autoplay attribute: -->
<!--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<video width="320" height="240" controls autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

</body>
</html>
-->
<!-- 
==> The autoplay attribute does not work in mobile devices like iPad and iPhone.
==> In HTML5, there are 3 supported video formats: MP4, WebM, and Ogg. 

==> <track> ==> Defines text tracks in media players
 <track src="subtitles_en.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
 
==> loop attribute:
	==> The loop attribute is a boolean attribute.
	==> When present, it specifies that the video will start over again, every time it is finished.
<video controls loop>

==> muted attribute:
	==> The muted attribute is a boolean attribute.
	==> When present, it specifies that the audio output of the video should be muted.
<video controls muted>
